/**
 * Word-timestamp refinement against voice activity.
 *
 * Whisper derives word timestamps by running DTW over the decoder's
 * cross-attention, and the result runs late. The error is not a constant offset:
 * on a 24 s test clip (2 s of digital silence at each end, so both endpoints are
 * unambiguous ground truth) the transcript trailed the audio by 0.34 s at t=2 s
 * but only 0.01 s at t=22 s, decaying steeply over the first few seconds. A
 * single global shift therefore under-corrects the opening and over-corrects the
 * tail. The bias survives every knob in the decode path — VAD slicing, the
 * Whisper lead pad, chunk length, decoder quantization — so it has to be
 * corrected after decoding.
 *
 * We already know where speech is: the per-frame VAD flags computed to slice the
 * audio. So:
 *
 * 1. `buildSpeechAnchors` matches each pause-adjacent word start to a VAD speech
 *    onset, giving a list of (decoded time → observed time) pairs.
 * 2. `alignWordsToSpeech` interpolates the correction linearly between those
 *    anchors, holding it constant outside them, which tracks the decay instead of
 *    assuming it away. Guards keep the map strictly increasing.
 * 3. `snapWordsToSpeech` then nudges remaining starts onto nearby onsets.
 *
 * Only *starts* are snapped, and only onsets are used as anchors. Silero holds a
 * speech flag for ~150 ms after speech actually stops, so anchoring word ends to
 * VAD offsets pushed the final word 0.16 s past the true end of the audio.
 *
 * `estimateSpeechLag` remains as the fallback for clips with too few pauses to
 * anchor. Everything here is pure and takes the frame flags directly, so it can
 * be tested without loading a model.
